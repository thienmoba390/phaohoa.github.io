description: "FireWorks is a free, open-source code for defining, managing, and executing\
  \ workflows. Complex workflows can be defined using Python, JSON, or YAML, are stored\
  \ using MongoDB, and can be monitored through a built-in web interface. Workflow\
  \ execution can be automated over arbitrary computing resources, including those\
  \ that have a queueing system. FireWorks has been used to run millions of workflows\
  \ encompassing tens of millions of CPU-hours across diverse application areas and\
  \ in long-term production projects over the span of multiple years."
